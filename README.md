# Enhanced Falling Sand Simulator

This is an enhanced version of the classic falling sand simulation made in Godot 4.1.2, providing improved mechanics, additional materials, and interactions beetween them. The project simulates various particle interactions, including sand, water, fire, and other elements, following basic physics and cellular automata principles.

## Features
- Particle-based physics simulation
- Multiple materials with unique interactions beetween them:
  - Sand
  - Water
  - Fire
  - Oil
  - Lava
  - Smoke
  - Wood
  - Gunpowder
- Slightly optimized performance for smoother rendering
- Simple and intuitive user interface

## How to Use
- Select a material from the available options.
- Click or drag on the canvas to place particles.
- Observe interactions and modify parameters as needed.

## Project Status
This project is a prototype and will not receive further development. It is not fully optimized.

## License
This project is available under the MIT License.
