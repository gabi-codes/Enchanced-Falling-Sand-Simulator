# Enhanced Falling Sand Simulator

An expanded and modernized take on the classic "falling sand" simulation, built in **Godot 4.1.2**.  
The project introduces improved mechanics, additional materials, and deeper interactions powered by **particle physics** and **cellular automata principles**.

This simulation demonstrates optimized real-time particle behavior and serves as a sandbox for experimenting with material interactions, emergent effects, and simple rule-based physics.
